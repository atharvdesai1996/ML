## System Design Questions for Jetson Nano & TinyML

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Detecting Defects in Manufacturing  
**Could a TinyML model running on Jetson Nano be used to detect defects in manufacturing using a low-power camera? What would be the key considerations?**  
- Model selection: CNN vs. lightweight object detection (YOLOv5-Tiny, MobileNet)  
- Camera resolution & lighting conditions  
- Data preprocessing: Filtering, noise reduction  
- Deployment constraints: Latency, memory usage  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Power Optimization for Battery-Powered Applications  
**If we want to use Jetson Nano for a battery-powered TinyML application, what power optimization techniques would you recommend?**  
- Use **Jetson Nano power modes** (`10W`, `5W`, `MAXN`)  
- Enable **dynamic frequency scaling (DVFS)**  
- Use **efficient deep learning models (quantization, pruning)**  
- Turn off unused peripherals (HDMI, USB)  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Debugging TinyML Performance on Jetson Nano  
**What debugging tools would you recommend for profiling TinyML performance on Jetson Nano?**  
- **NVIDIA Jetson Stats (`jtop`)** ‚Üí Monitor CPU, GPU, power usage  
- **TensorRT Profiler** ‚Üí Optimize and debug AI inference  
- **NVIDIA Nsight** ‚Üí Profiling tool for CUDA & Deep Learning  
- **TegraStats (`tegrastats`)** ‚Üí Monitors real-time system performance
