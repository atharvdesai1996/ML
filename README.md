## Use Cases
### LCD based interface soil moisture monitoring
* Local LCD capturing plant emotions
* Pros -
* Cons -

### Remote App based Operation
* Wifi based
* No need for LCD (high power consumption on end device)
* Pros
* Cons - need to be in proximity of wifi


### ESP32WROOM Interfacing with Sensors & LCD:

## ESP32 set up in Arduino
Correct Board Selection for ESP-WROOM-32
In Arduino IDE, choose:
Tools ‚Üí Board ‚Üí ESP32 Dev Module
This is the most compatible and commonly used board definition for ESP-WROOM-32 modules.
üîß Steps to Set Up:
Install ESP32 Board Support (if not done yet):
Go to File ‚Üí Preferences
In "Additional Boards Manager URLs", add:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json
Then go to Tools ‚Üí Board ‚Üí Boards Manager
Search for ESP32 and install the "esp32 by Espressif Systems" package
Select Board:
Go to Tools ‚Üí Board ‚Üí ESP32 Dev Module
Quick Tip:
The ESP-WROOM-32 is the name of the module, not the dev board.
But "ESP32 Dev Module" is a generic dev board profile compatible with most WROOM-based boards like DOIT, TTGO, etc.

## System Design Questions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Detecting Defects in Manufacturing  
**Could a TinyML model running on Jetson Nano be used to detect defects in manufacturing using a low-power camera? What would be the key considerations?**  
- Model selection: CNN vs. lightweight object detection (YOLOv5-Tiny, MobileNet)  
- Camera resolution & lighting conditions  
- Data preprocessing: Filtering, noise reduction  
- Deployment constraints: Latency, memory usage
