### Applications
## Object Detection (Basic TinyML Models)
* 

## Gesture & Motion Recognition
*

### ESP32WROOM Interfacing with Sensors & LCD:

## ESP32 set up in Arduino
Correct Board Selection for ESP-WROOM-32
In Arduino IDE, choose:
Tools → Board → ESP32 Dev Module
This is the most compatible and commonly used board definition for ESP-WROOM-32 modules.
🔧 Steps to Set Up:
Install ESP32 Board Support (if not done yet):
Go to File → Preferences
In "Additional Boards Manager URLs", add:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json
Then go to Tools → Board → Boards Manager
Search for ESP32 and install the "esp32 by Espressif Systems" package
Select Board:
Go to Tools → Board → ESP32 Dev Module
Quick Tip:
The ESP-WROOM-32 is the name of the module, not the dev board.
But "ESP32 Dev Module" is a generic dev board profile compatible with most WROOM-based boards like DOIT, TTGO, etc.

## System Design Questions for Jetson Nano & TinyML

### 1️⃣ Detecting Defects in Manufacturing  
**Could a TinyML model running on Jetson Nano be used to detect defects in manufacturing using a low-power camera? What would be the key considerations?**  
- Model selection: CNN vs. lightweight object detection (YOLOv5-Tiny, MobileNet)  
- Camera resolution & lighting conditions  
- Data preprocessing: Filtering, noise reduction  
- Deployment constraints: Latency, memory usage  

### 2️⃣ Power Optimization for Battery-Powered Applications  
**If we want to use Jetson Nano for a battery-powered TinyML application, what power optimization techniques would you recommend?**  
- Use **Jetson Nano power modes** (`10W`, `5W`, `MAXN`)  
- Enable **dynamic frequency scaling (DVFS)**  
- Use **efficient deep learning models (quantization, pruning)**  
- Turn off unused peripherals (HDMI, USB)  

### 3️⃣ Debugging TinyML Performance on Jetson Nano  
**What debugging tools would you recommend for profiling TinyML performance on Jetson Nano?**  
- **NVIDIA Jetson Stats (`jtop`)** → Monitor CPU, GPU, power usage  
- **TensorRT Profiler** → Optimize and debug AI inference  
- **NVIDIA Nsight** → Profiling tool for CUDA & Deep Learning  
- **TegraStats (`tegrastats`)** → Monitors real-time system performance
